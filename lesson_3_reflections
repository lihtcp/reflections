Question 1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You might want to use a remote respository if you are working with multiple people, and each
person is going to be working on the same project. It also might be helpful if you use multiple
computers for a single project, so that you can pick up where you left off on the project,
no matter which computer you are using. You can also use the remote repository if you would 
like to make your work public, and allow others to comment and give you change suggestions.
